# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using C++. The game allows the player to control a snake and navigate it around the screen to eat food and grow in length. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Randomly generated food for the snake to eat
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress
- Game over screen with the option to restart

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
2. The snake will automatically move in the direction indicated by the arrow keys.
3. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
4. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body.
5. Press the "R" key to restart the game after it ends.
